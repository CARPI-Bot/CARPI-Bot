# CARPI Bot

The Discord bot built for RPI students! Featuring easy searching of events from the academic calendar, courses from the course catalog, as well as access to other commonly used RPI resources all through the Discord client, we hope that our bot will be a friend to you in your everyday academic endeavors.

## Quick Start

**1. Discord Account** \
As CARPI Bot operates on the social & messaging platform Discord, you'll need to [create an account](https://discord.com/ "Click to redirect!") to interact with it if you haven't already.

**2. Add CARPI Bot to Your Discord Server** \
Once you're ready, use this [invite link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1067560443444478034&permissions=8&scope=bot+applications.commands "Click to invite CARPI Bot to a server!") to add CARPI Bot to your server! You must have the `Manage Server` permission within the server you want to invite the bot to.

**3. You're Done!** \
Once CARPI Bot is in your server, all of its commands are at your disposal! Use the `/help` command for a list of comands.
